Our research group is dedicated to developing targeted therapeutic strategies against quiescent cancer cells (QCCs) in solid tumours. We primarily focus on neuroblastoma, triple-negative breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. By elucidating the molecular and cellular characteristics of QCCs, we aim to uncover their critical contributions to tumour progression, therapy resistance, relapse, and metastasis. Through innovative translational approaches, we seek to translate these insights into novel, precision-based treatments that exploit cancer-specific vulnerabilities.

Despite significant advances in cancer therapy, recurrence in solid tumours remains a leading cause of mortality. This is frequently driven by quiescent cancer cells (QCCs), which can persist in a dormant state for years before re-entering the cell cycle and triggering relapse—particularly in paediatric and young adult patients. Targeting the survival mechanisms of QCCs represents a promising strategy to overcome treatment resistance and prevent long-term recurrence. However, progress has been limited by the scarcity of robust models capable of reliably distinguishing QCCs from proliferating tumour cells.

To overcome these limitations, we have developed several QCC-reporter cell models that enable precise identification and study of quiescent populations across different tumour types. Using these tools, we have identified two key genes that are essential for QCC survival. These genes are now being targeted by novel small-molecule inhibitors identified through our ongoing high-throughput drug screening efforts. Furthermore, our work has revealed a strong correlation between one of these genes and mitochondrial function, highlighting a previously underappreciated link between QCC dormancy and metabolic reprogramming.

We are committed to advancing cancer therapeutics through interdisciplinary collaboration. Talented researchers who share our vision are warmly invited to explore our ongoing projects, publications and open positions, we are currently recruiting postdoctoral researchers and PhD students, if you are interested in working on a degree project with us, feel free to reach out as well.
