Despite advancements in cancer treatment, recurrence in solid tumors—often driven by quiescent cancer cells (QCCs)—remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. These dormant cells can remain inactive for years before re-entering the cell cycle, significantly increasing the risk of relapse, especially in younger patients. Targeting the survival mechanisms of QCCs offers a promising approach to overcoming treatment resistance and preventing long-term recurrence. However, the study of QCCs has been challenging due to the lack of models and methods to clearly differentiate them from proliferating tumor cells.

To address this, we have established several QCC-reporter cell models, giving us an invaluable opportunity to discover and study the unique characteristics of QCCs across different tumor types. In our research, we have identified two key genes that play an important role in QCC survival, which can be targeted by newly identified small molecules from our current drug screening efforts. Additionally, we have observed a strong correlation between the expression of the gene and mitochondrial function, suggesting a potential link between QCCs and metabolic pathways.

Our aim is to develop therapeutic strategies that specifically target QCCs in various solid tumors, with a primary focus on neuroblastoma, triple-negative breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. We hope that this work will uncover the unique features of QCCs and provide a deeper understanding of their role in tumor growth, relapse, and metastasis.
